This\n  ‘Licence does not define the extent of modification or dependence on the\n  ‘Original Work required in order to classify a work as a Derivative Work;\n  ‘this extent is determined by copyright law applicable in the country\n  ‘mentioned in Article 15.\n— ‘The Work’: the Original Work or its Derivative Works.\n— ‘The Source Code’: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most\n  convenient for people to study and modify.\n— ‘The Executable Code’: any code which has generally been compiled and which\n  is meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program.\n— ‘The Licensor’: the natural or legal person that distributes or communicates\n  the Work under the Licence.\n— ‘Contributor(s)’: any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under\n  the Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work.\n— ‘The Licensee’ or ‘You’: any natural or legal person who makes any usage of\n  the Work under the terms of the Licence.\n— ‘Distribution’ or ‘Communication’: any act of selling, giving, lending,\n  renting, distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making\n  available, online or offline, copies of the Work or providing access to its\n  essential functionalities at the disposal of any other natural or legal\n  person.\n\nScope of the rights granted by the Licence\n\nThe Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,\nsublicensable licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright\nvested in the Original Work:\n— use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage,\n— reproduce the Work,\n— modify the Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work,\n— communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display\n  the Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case\n  may be, the Work,\n— distribute the Work or copies thereof,\n— lend and rent the Work or copies thereof,\n— sublicense rights in the Work or copies thereof.\nThose rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now\nknown or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.\nIn the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to\nexercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make\neffective the licence of the economic rights here above listed.\nThe Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non-exclusive usage rights\nto any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of\nthe rights granted on the Work under this Licence.\n\nCommunication of the Source Code\n\nThe Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as\nExecutable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor\nprovides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work\nalong with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates,\nin a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository\nwhere the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the\nLicensor continues to distribute or communicate the Work.\n\nLimitations on copyright\n\nNothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits\nfrom any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners\nin the Work, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable\nlimitations thereto.\n\nObligations of the Licensee\n\nThe grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and\nobligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:\nAttribution right: The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or\ntrademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the\ndisclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and\na copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes or\ncommunicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent\nnotices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.\nCopyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes or communicates copies of the\nOriginal Works or Derivative Works, this Distribution or Communication will be\ndone under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence\nunless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under this version of\nthe Licence — for example by communicating ‘EUPL v. 1.2 only’. The Licensee\n(becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions\non the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the\nLicence.\nCompatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes or Communicates Derivative\nWorks or copies thereof based upon both the Work and another work licensed\nunder a Compatible Licence, this Distribution or Communication can be done\nunder the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause,\n‘Compatible Licence’ refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to\nthis Licence. Should the Licensee's obligations under the Compatible Licence\nconflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the\nCompatible Licence shall prevail.\nProvision of Source Code: When distributing or communicating copies of the\nWork, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or\nindicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available\nfor as long as the Licensee continues to distribute or communicate the Work.\nLegal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade\nnames, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required\nfor reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and\nreproducing the content of the copyright notice.\n\nChain of Authorship\n\nThe original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted\nhereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the\npower and authority to grant the Licence.\nEach Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she\nbrings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she\nhas the power and authority to grant the Licence.\nEach time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent\nContributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the\nterms of this Licence.\n\nDisclaimer of Warranty\n\nThe Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous\nContributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or\n‘bugs’ inherent to this type of development.\nFor the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an ‘as is’\nbasis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including\nwithout limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence\nof defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property\nrights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.\nThis disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a\ncondition for the grant of any rights to the Work.\n\nDisclaimer of Liability\n\nExcept in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural\npersons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect,\nmaterial or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the\nuse of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill,\nwork stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial\ndamage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such\ndamage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability\nlaws as far such laws apply to the Work.\n\nAdditional agreements\n\nWhile distributing the Work, You may choose to conclude an additional\nagreement, defining obligations or services consistent with this Licence.\nHowever, if accepting obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on\nyour sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other\nContributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each\nContributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against\nsuch Contributor by the fact You have accepted any warranty or additional\nliability.\n\nAcceptance of the Licence\n\nThe provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon ‘I\nagree’ placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence\nor by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules\nof applicable law.

Such a termination\nwill not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work from\nthe Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full\ncompliance with the Licence.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nWithout prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete\nagreement between the Parties as to the Work.\nIf any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable\nlaw, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a\nwhole. Such provision will be construed or reformed so as necessary to make it\nvalid and enforceable.\nThe European Commission may publish other linguistic versions or new versions\nof this Licence or updated versions of the Appendix, so far this is required\nand reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the\nLicence. New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version\nnumber.\nAll linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission,\nhave identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of\ntheir choice.\n\nJurisdiction\n\nWithout prejudice to specific agreement between parties,\n— any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising\n  between the European Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, as a\n  Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court\n  of Justice of the European Union, as laid down in article 272 of the Treaty\n  on the Functioning of the European Union,\n— any litigation arising between other parties and resulting from the\n  interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive\n  jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts\n  its primary business.\n\nApplicable Law\n\nWithout prejudice to specific agreement between parties,\n— this Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union Member State\n  where the Licensor has his seat, resides or has his registered office,\n— this licence shall be governed by Belgian law if the Licensor has no seat,\n  residence or registered office inside a European Union Member State.\nAppendix\n‘Compatible Licences’ according to Article 5 EUPL
