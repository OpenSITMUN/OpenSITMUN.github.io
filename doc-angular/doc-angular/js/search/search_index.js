Such a termination\nwill not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work from\nthe Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full\ncompliance with the Licence.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nWithout prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete\nagreement between the Parties as to the Work.\nIf any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable\nlaw, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a\nwhole. Such provision will be construed or reformed so as necessary to make it\nvalid and enforceable.\nThe European Commission may publish other linguistic versions or new versions\nof this Licence or updated versions of the Appendix, so far this is required\nand reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the\nLicence.

this License, will be subject to the exclusive\n  jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts\n  its primary business.\n\nApplicable Law\n\nWithout prejudice to specific agreement between parties,\n— this Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union Member State\n  where the Licensor has his seat, resides or has his registered office,\n— this licence shall be governed by Belgian law if the Licensor has no seat,\n  residence or registered office inside a European Union Member State.\nAppendix\n‘Compatible Licences’ according to Article 5 EUPL

client side that communicates with Spring Boot on the server side via REST API.\nIn this document we will focus on the Angular client side development. SITMUN Angular application development is based on SITMUN Core Angular Library and Angular Material components.\nIn order to develop an Angular SITMUN application, there are a handful of setup steps to go through that vary based on your app environment. In order to simplify the process, we provide a demo application, that you can take advantage of it.\nGenerally, the steps are:\n\nDownload the demo application repository\nConfigure Spring\nConfigure Angular\nCustomize Application Layout\nCustomize Application Navigation\nAdd Components to Application\n\nIn the next sections we will see how to develop a SITMUN Application consisting of a toolbar, a sidebar navigation, a login/logout component, an account data editor, a password change tool and a map component.\nRequirements\n\nGit\nJava 8 release\nNode 8.x (LTS) or greater LTS release\n\nSetup\nInit\n\nCreate a folder with the proper name for your application.\nDownload the SITMUN Demo application repository (provided by us as an app template) inside the created folder.\nFrom the command line, go to the created folder and execute: git init.\n\nConfiguring Spring\nConfigure your application artifact identifier in the ./build.gradle file by changing the value of the artifactId property (sitmun-demo-app):\npublishing {\n    publications {\n        mavenJava(MavenPublication) {\n            groupId group\n            artifactId 'sitmun-demo-app'\n            version version\n            from components.java\n        }\n    }\n}Rename the java package org.sitmun.app.demo to whichever package name you choose using a code refactoring code tool like Eclipse.\nCreate a Spring Boot configuration YML file by renaming ./src/main/resources/application-h2.yml to ./src/main/resources/application.yml and change the application name property:\n...\nspring:\n    application:\n        name: sitmun-demo-app\n...In order to change the application version it is required to edit the ./gradle.properties file and change the sitmun_version property value:\n...\nsitmun_version=0.0.1-SNAPSHOT\n...Configuring Angular\nChange the Angular application name by editing the ./angular.json file and changing the projects.webapp.root property:\n...\n\"projects\": {\n    \"webapp\": {\n        \"root\": \"Sitmun Demo Application\",\n        ...\n    }\n}Change the Angular application version by editing the ./package.json file and changing the version property value:\n...\n\"version\": \"0.6.1\",\n...Launch development environment\nIn order to set up an environment for developing the Angular application we have to follow these steps:\n\nFrom the command line, go to the created folder.\nBuild the Spring application with ./gradlew assemble.\nRun the Spring application with ./gradlew bootRun.\nRun teh Angular application with ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json and open the http://localhost:4200 url from a browser.\n\nApplication Layout\nThe application general layout is located in the ./src/main/angular/app/app.component.html file and consists of a toolbar with a content zone below with a left sidebar navigation:  \n\n    \n        ...\n    \n    \n        \n            \n            ...\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n    \nThe layout is implemented using Angular Material Design components that are included in the .src/main/angular/app/app.module.ts file as imports. Every module, component or service used in the application must be declared in this file.\nCustomize Toolbar\nThe application toolbar consists of a toggle menu a home link with the application logo and a text area with the name of the application:\n...\n\n    \n        menu\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    Sitmun Demo App\n    \n    \n    ...\n\n...As we can see in the above code snippet the logo file is located at the relative path assets/logo.png. We can change the logo by replacing the logo file located in the src/main/angular/assets/ or by adding a new image file in the same folder and accordingly changing the src atributte value in the  tag.\nWe can add new components to the toolbar, for instance, a language toolset:\n...\nCA\nES\nEN\n...As we can see in the above code snippet we've added  3 buttons for change application language to 3 different languages.\nThe language change action is triggered using the changeLanguage function. This function is defined in the .src/main/angular/app/app.module.ts file:\n...\nchangeLanguage(locale: string ){\n    this.translate.use(locale);\n}\n...Customize Navigation\nApplication navigation is defined in the .src/main/angular/app/app.module.ts file. In the Demo Application we define 4 navigation nodes/pages that are implemented with 3 SITMUN Core Angular Library components  (LoginComponent, AccountEditComponent, AccountChangePasswordComponent) and the Demo Application home component (HomeComponent):\nconst appRoutes: Routes = [\n    {\n        path: '',\n        component: HomeComponent\n    },\n    {\n        path: 'login',\n        component: LoginComponent\n    },\n    {\n        path: 'account',\n        component: AccountEditComponent\n    },\n    {\n        path: 'change-password',\n        component: AccountChangePasswordComponent\n    }\n];This pages can be accessed by the navigation links (see [routerLink] attributes in the a tags) defined in the sidebar menu defined in .src/main/angular/app/app.component.html:\n...\n\n    \n        {{'menu.account'| translate}}\n        {{'account.data'| translate}}\n        {{'account.change-password'| translate}}\n        {{'account.closeSession'| translate}}\n    \n    \n        \n             {{'global.login'|translate}}\n        \n    \n\n...Customize Home Component\nHome Component is the only local component provided by our application and is rendered when application is first loaded and root navigation.\nThis component as any Angular component mainly consists  of 2 files: an html file with the component template (home.component.html) and a typescript file (home.component.ts) with the component class, both located at the .src/main/angular/app/home/ folder.\nWe can customize this component by modifying this files and adding/configring SITMUN Core Angular Library components, other external components or local components developed for our application.\nIn the next section we'ĺl add a map viewer component (MapComponent) from  SITMUN Core Angular Library to our HomeComponent.\nAdding and configuring a Map Component\nIn order to add a map viewer component to our home component, first we have to modify .src/main/angular/app/app.module.ts and import the map configuration service (MapConfigurationManagerService) configuring this service as a provider inside our application:\n...\nimport { MapConfigurationManagerService } from 'sitmun-plugin-core';\n...\nproviders: [\n    ...\n    //Map Configuration Service\n    MapConfigurationManagerService\n]\n...MapConfigurationManagerService enables MapComponent layer customization.\nNow we can add the map component to our home component by placing the map component tag (sitmun-map-viewer-map) inside the home component template placed at .src/main/angular/app/home/:  \nIn the code above, we can see some of the map component input parameters, which are the following:\n\nextent: array of numbers representing the extent of the initial view of the map component: [minx, miny, maxx, maxy].\ninitialProjection: code of the srs projection of the coordinates defined in extent, initialLon and initialLat\ninitialLon: x-coordinate of initial center of the map\ninitialLat: y-coordinate of initial center of the map\ninitialZoom: initial zoom of the map\n\nIn order to add further configuration to the map component we have to import some required components and classes from SITMUN Core Angular Library in home component class (home.component.ts):\nimport {Principal,\n        LoginService,\n        MapConfigurationManagerService,\n        Layer,\n        LayerGroup,\n        MapOptionsConfiguration,\n        OptionalParameter,\n        MapComponentStatus} from 'sitmun-plugin-core';Then we inject MapConfigurationManagerService in HomeComponent creation by adding to the constructor method:\nconstructor(\n...\n    private mapConfigurationManagerService: MapConfigurationManagerService,\n...\n)In the next sections we'ĺl see how we can configure other aspects of the map using MapConfigurationManagerService.\nConfigure Map Extent, Scales and Tiles\nIf we want to configure map extent, scales and tiles, then we´ll have to create a MapOptionsConfiguration object and set the proper values:\n\nscales: List of map scales\nprojections: List of available crs\nminScale: Minimum scale\nmaxScale: Maximum scale\nextent: Initial Extent\nmaxExtent: Maximum Extent\ntileWidth: tile width\ntileHeight: tile height\n\nIn the code below we can see an example configuration of MapOptionsConfiguration:\n // Set map configuration\n    let mapOptionsConfiguration = new MapOptionsConfiguration();\n    mapOptionsConfiguration.scales = [\n        1000000, 700000, ​500000, 400000,\n        300000, 200000, 100000, 50000, 25000,\n        20000, 10000, 5001, 2500, 1000, 500].join();\n    mapOptionsConfiguration.projections = [\"EPSG:25831\"].join();\n    mapOptionsConfiguration.minScale = 3000;\n    mapOptionsConfiguration.maxScale = 3000000;\n    //Overrides the directive parameter\n    mapOptionsConfiguration.extent = [\n        256901.08041000657, // xMin\n        4544669.980255321,  // yMin\n        554715.9195899934,  // xMax\n        4703023.019744679   // yMax\n    ];\n    mapOptionsConfiguration.maxExtent = [\n        320000,     // xMin\n        4561229,    // yMin\n        491617,     // xMax\n        4686464     // yMax\n    ];\n    mapOptionsConfiguration.tileWidth = 500;\n    mapOptionsConfiguration.tileHeight = 500;\n\n    this.mapConfigurationManagerService\n        .loadMapOptionsConfiguration(mapOptionsConfiguration);Configure Layers\nIn order to add and configure layers y layer groups to the map component we'll have use the following classes by the SITMUN Core Angular Library.\nLayer\nThe Layer class configure Layer data and displaying configuration by setting the following parameters:\n\nvisibility: Visibility\nopacity: Transparency (Transparent) 0-1 (Opaque)\ntitle: Title\nid: Id to index\nserverName: Service Name\nattributions: Service attributions\nformat: Request format (image / jpg ...)\nversion: Request service version\nurl: Service url\nisBaseLayer: Us base layer?\nname: Request layer name\ntiled: Is tiled?\ndesc: Description\nurl_transparent: Transparent request parameter?\nurl_bgcolor: Request Background parameter color (Hexa)\nurl_exception: Request Exception URL\nextent: Extent for tiled services\ntileHeight: Tile height (if not defined, the default map is taken)\ntileWidth: Tile width (if not defined, the default map is taken)\nqueryable: Enabled for GetFeatureInfo requests (enabled to use the viewer features information tool)\nminimumScale: Minimum scale\nmaximumScale: Maximum scale\nprojections: List of available CRS\ninfoUrl: Features information URL\nmetadataUrl: Metadata information URL\nlegendUrl: Legend URL\noptionalParameters: Array of OptionalParameter object that defines other optional parameter-value pairs for the request (TIME ...)\n\nOptionalParameter\nThe OptionalParameter class configure parameter-value pair to add to the request layer URL by setting the following parameters:\n\nkey: Parameter name\nvalue: Parameter value\n\nLayerConfiguration\nThe LayerConfiguration  lass modify the configuration of a layer when interacting with the map (make visible, move the layer ...) by setting the following parameters:\n\nid: Identifier to index\nvisibility: Layer visibility\nopacity: Layer transparency (Transparent) 0-1 (Opaque)\nposition: Layer position\n\nLayerGroup\nThe LayerGroup class configure a Layer group by setting the following parameters:\n\nactive: Initially activated (all visible layers)\nname: Group Name\nid: Group id\nlayers: Array of child Layers\n\nConfigure Base layers\nTo configure the base layers of the map we must use the loadBaseLayersConfiguration method of MapConfigurationManagerService, to which we will pass as an parameter an array of objects of type LayerGroup each of them with the corresponding Layer objects defining the layers to load.\nIn the code below we can see an example configuration of the map component base layers:\nlet baseLayersConfiguration = new Array();\n\nvar layerGroup = new LayerGroup();\nlayerGroup.id = \"map\";\nlayerGroup.name = \"MAP\"; //Name to be shown in the base layer selector tool\nlayerGroup.layers = [];\n\n//Each layer will be a request to a map service\nvar layer = new Layer();\nlayer[\"visibility\"] = false;\n// Sets if this layer's service could be requested for additional information of a selected location on the map\nlayer[\"queryable\"] = false;\n// Opacity for this layer image in the map\nlayer[\"opacity\"] = 1;\nlayer[\"attributions\"] = \"© Institut Cartogràfíc i Geològic de Catalunya\";\n// WMS request transparent parameter\nlayer[\"url_transparent\"] = \"TRUE\";\n// WMS request background color parameter\nlayer[\"url_bgcolor\"] =
